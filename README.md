# openserverless mcp

An MCP server for OpenServerless. It exposes the OpenServerless action tools
(previously the `@opencode-ai/plugin` tools under `trustable-app/tools/`) over the
Model Context Protocol so any MCP-capable agent can drive them.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `action_new` | Idempotently create an API endpoint (`__main__.py` + module file). `public` defaults to true. |
| `action_invoke` | Run `ops invoke <endpoint>` with `key=value` params and return the JSON result. |
| `action_requirements` | Check a library against the Python runtime ([requirements.txt](requirements.txt)); refuses anything the runtime does not ship. |
| `action_add_secret` | Wire a `.env` secret into an endpoint's context as `ctx.<SECRET>`. |
| `secret_status` | Check secret presence and endpoint bindings without reading its value. |
| `secret_bind` | Atomically bind the same secret to multiple endpoints. |
| `secret_unbind` | Atomically remove an obsolete generated binding without reading or deleting the secret. |
| `auth_setup` | Atomically wire Redis into all token-issuing, protected/session, and logout endpoints; never writes `.env` or configures JWT. |
| `action_add_s3` | Add bucket-scoped S3 to an endpoint's context (`ctx.S3_CLIENT`, `ctx.S3_DATA`, `ctx.S3_WEB`, `ctx.S3_PUBLIC`); forbids `list_buckets` and requires `put_object` → `get_object`/compare → `delete_object` for read/write verification. |
| `action_add_postgresql` | Add PostgreSQL (`ctx.POSTGRESQL`). |
| `action_add_redis` | Add Redis (`ctx.REDIS`, `ctx.REDIS_PREFIX`) and its Python runtime dependency; use it for opaque authenticated sessions. |
| `action_add_milvus` | Add Milvus vector DB (`ctx.MILVUS`). |
| `action_add_mongodb` | Add MongoDB (`ctx.MONGODB_CLIENT`, `ctx.MONGODB`). |

The `endpoint` argument is either `name` (uses the `v1` package) or
`package/name`. Both segments must start with a letter and contain only letters,
numbers, and hyphens. Use flat hyphenated names such as
`v1/employees-photo`; underscores, spaces, nested routes, and forms such as
`v1/employees_photo` or `v1/employees/photo` are invalid.
Repeating `action_new` for a compatible existing endpoint is a successful check
that leaves its files unchanged; incomplete paths and visibility conflicts are
reported as MCP errors.

Secret values are never returned by these tools. Missing secrets and invalid
endpoints are MCP errors (`isError: true`), so clients cannot mistake an
incomplete binding for a successful tool call. `action_add_secret` remains as
the single-endpoint compatibility tool; use `secret_bind` when several actions
must share one user-configured credential.

Application `.env` and `.env.production` files are owned by Trustant's
user-facing configuration flow. The MCP performs only value-free presence
checks needed for binding validation and never creates, edits, imports,
synchronizes, regenerates, or automatically populates those files. A missing
variable must be added by the user through Trustant.

Application authentication uses Redis-backed opaque sessions. Create login,
registration, `me`/session, every protected endpoint, and logout, then call
`auth_setup` once with those complete endpoint sets. Store token-to-identity
mappings under keys derived from `ctx.REDIS_PREFIX` with a bounded TTL; never
use JWT or an application signing secret as a substitute.

## Working directory

All path-based tools operate on paths **relative to the process working
directory**: they read/write `packages/<pkg>/<name>/...` and `.env`. The server
must therefore be launched with the user's app checkout as its CWD (this is how
opencode launches `type: "local"` MCP servers).

## Layout

```
src/
  index.ts            entrypoint — registers every tool over stdio
  lib.ts              shared helpers (endpoint parsing, connector injection, types)
  secrets.ts          secret name, .env, status, and atomic binding helpers
  tools/
    new.ts            action_new
    invoke.ts         action_invoke
    requirements.ts   action_requirements
    add-secret.ts     action_add_secret
    add-s3.ts         action_add_s3
    add-postgresql.ts action_add_postgresql
    add-redis.ts      action_add_redis
    add-milvus.ts     action_add_milvus
    add-mongodb.ts    action_add_mongodb
    secret-status.ts  secret_status
    secret-bind.ts    secret_bind
    secret-unbind.ts  secret_unbind
    auth-setup.ts     auth_setup
```

Each file under `tools/` default-exports a `Tool` (`defineTool({ name, config, handler })`);
`index.ts` imports them all and registers them in a loop. To add a tool, drop a
file in `tools/` and add it to the array in `index.ts`.

## Run

Requires Node 18+ and `ops` on the `PATH`. TypeScript runs directly via `tsx`.

```bash
npm install
npm start          # tsx src/index.ts — speaks MCP over stdio
```

## Wire into opencode

Add to the app's `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "openserverless": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "tsx", "/path/to/mcp/src/index.ts"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
